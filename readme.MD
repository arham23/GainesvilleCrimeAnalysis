Data Science Final Project - Gainesville Crime Analysis

GainesvilleCrimeAnalysis.ipynb:
Notebook where initial experiments were run as well as where we began to analyze and visualize the data. Here we determined things such as the most common crime type, the relationship between the number of incidents and time of day, number of incidents and day of week, and number of incidents in each police district. We also began our classification tasks here by experimenting with various models outlined in the report and assessing their accuracy.
