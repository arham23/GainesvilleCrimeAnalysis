Data Science Final Project - Gainesville Crime Analysis

GainesvilleCrimeAnalysis.ipynb:
Notebook where initial experiments were run as well as where we began to analyze and visualize the data. Here we determined things such as the most common crime type, the relationship between the number of incidents and time of day, number of incidents and day of week, and number of incidents in each police district. We also began our classification tasks here by experimenting with various models outlined in the report and assessing their accuracy.

FrequentPatternMining.ipynb:
Here we did data wrangling and use Frequent Pattern Growth Algorithm to find frequent patterns of crimes. Four types of data are used, Gainesville Police District, Time Interval, Report day of week and Incident Type. We get the most frequent itemsets for each length of itemsets.
